            <h1>You're a young enchanter/enchantress by the name of Cypress. You live in Helios, a small town in the country of Cordovia. Cordovia isn't the most guarded place, as any sort of security is sent to the front lines of battle. You endure this life with your mother and twin siblings, Sam and Sal. One fresh morn, you're awoken from your slumber to the sound of screams and bloodshed. You hear banging on your home's front door. What will you do? </h1>
